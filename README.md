# Predicting Electric Vehicle Temperature

We are using data from the university in paderborn (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature). 
We fit a XGBoost regressor to predict the temperature of the permanent magnet in Â°C.
Although we didnt tune any hyperparameters, the prediction performance is quite good.

## Results:

The MSE was: 6.932819018488115
